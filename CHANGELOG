0.9.8 Beta
08-11-25 - recompiled lazarus/fpc to version 4.3 with fixes in trunk. This fixes several irritating little things
08-11-25 - Increased execution speed through the exec routines in binexec
08-11-25 - Fixed a long standing error in the exec routines. This sometimes caused the checkup and other routines to  get no input from dnf5. This would result in not listing items into an info box, or reporting that no updates were waiting. Both root and non-root exec functions seem to be working as intended and are stable now.
08-10-25 - More help pages done. Need to decide whether to build the Help system around individual help .html files of compile into a single .CHM file.

08-05-25 - Wrote several of the help pages and set up the help system in the program
08-05-25 - Fixed a bug in checkup. It was looking for the wrong condition to set ok = true resulting in erratic behaviour.
- Fixed several errors in the setup script file. it was not setting permissions correctly. This file will not be needed once rpmgr is packaged.
- fixed critical errors in the db creation routines and re-wrote several for better speed and to ensure that installed files actually get marked as installed.
- Found an extra space in one of the command strings that was silently keeping repo updates from running.
- code cleanup and optimizations.
