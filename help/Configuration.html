    <h1 align="center">Configuration</h1>
    <font size="+2" face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">When you install
      RPMgr and run it for the first time, it has to setup several files
      and databases to get the program ready to manage your systems
      packages and groups. You will see a notice panel telling you what
      is going on. The process may take some time (up to a couple of
      minutes) depending upon the speed of your computer, the speed of
      your internet connection, and what type of storage your computer
      uses (hard drive or SSD normally). Mst modern machines will allow
      this to be completed in well under one minute.<br>
      <br>
      From that point onward, RPMgr will handle everything on it's own.
      The program will still take a few seconds to start each time it is
      run. This is because it has to check to see if there are any
      updates available for your system. If there are updates, you will
      see a notice appear that you have to acknowledge by clicking the
      OK button. From there, you will see the main window below.<br>
      <img src="file:///mnt/Data/Pictures/Screenshots/main.png"
        alt="main" width="1704" height="1010"><br>
      This is where you will spend the majority of your time in RPMgr,
      so let's look around a bit. <br>
      <br>
      You can change the way the program looks, and how it handles
      updates. To do that, click on the Options item in the main menu at
      the top left of the window.<br>
      <img src="file:///mnt/Data/Pictures/Screenshots/config.png"
        alt="config" width="574" height="690"><br>
      This is the configuration dialog. At the top is a check box for
      Offline updates. This defaults to being checked on a new
      installation. It means that fedora will do all of it's updates
      only after rebooting to install those update packages. With this
      selected (checked) after each set of updated packages is
      downloaded, you will be required to reboot the system so that
      those updated packages can be installed while in a safe mode
      environment. You will see the installation progress bar while the
      updates are being installed, and then your system will reboot
      again into it's normal mode with a bunch or bright, shiny new
      updated packages installed. This is the default mode for Fedora to
      update packages, so it is the default for RPMgr as well.<br>
      <br>
      If you uncheck this option,, updates are are bit different. When
      you click the install button on the updates dialog, the process is
      the same as doing an offline update, except the packages are being
      installed right now, in real time. This is the way that all Linux
      systems worked since the mid 1990's. It is the "old school way".
      There are lots of opinions as to which method is better, but both
      get the job done. The offline way has the advantage of being able
      to update all packages whether critical system or normal program
      packages in a bit safer way.<br>
      <br>
      After the update in the standard mode, you will not be required to
      reboot. You will be told if any critical system files were updated
      that require a reboot to load the new updates and use them. So you
      can still reboot here if you want to do so. See the Updates
      section of the help for more information on the update process.<br>
      <br>
      Next, you can change colors that the program uses if you want to
      make it your own. Each of the colored boxes are buttons, so you
      can click the ones that you want to change. Each will bring up a
      color picker so that you can select a pre-defined color, or mix
      your own custom color. Once you have the colors that you think you
      want, click the Save button and those colors will be applied to
      all windows within RPMgr. If you decide you don't like some or all
      of your choices, just do it again until you like it.<br>
      <br>
      Your choices will stay until you change them again, even after an
      update to the program.<br>
