      This is where you add a new repository. You must add at least a
      repository name, and a URL that has the config file for a Fedora
      style repository. If you have the config file locally (on your
      system), then you can enter the path to that config file like this
      :<br>
      <br>
      file:///path/to/config.repo<br>
      <br>
      dnf5 will then do all of the work of setting up the new repo and
      importing all of the package information. If you left the Enabled
      checkbox checked, then the packages that are contained in that
      repository will be made available to you. The databases will need
      to be updated, and this will happen automatically. The update
      process takes some time, but you will get a notice that it is
      happening,.<br>
