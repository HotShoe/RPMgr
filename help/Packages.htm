      The package grid lists the packages associated with the currently
      selected Group. These packages may or may not be installed. Look
      for the check mark at the left of each listing. Virtually any
      needed action can be done from this grid. You must have a package
      highlighted to perform an action on it. You can do that by
      clicking the line that the package is on, or by scrolling with
      your mouse scroll wheel, or the scrollbar on the right. You can
      click with either the left or right mouse buttons. Both will
      highlight the package, but the right button will also display the
      popup help menu. <br>

      This grid has a pop-up menu that allows you to perform various
      tasks like installing, removing, reinstalling, or listing the
      contents of a package. To display the menu, make sure your mouse
      pointer is inside the package grid, and click with the Right mouse
      button. The menu is specific to what you have highlighted at the
      time. If you have an installed package highlighted, the Install
      item will not be available, but Uninstall, reinstall, and List
      contents, will be available. </font><br>
