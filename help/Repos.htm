      This is the repository Management window. Here you can enable,
      disable, add, or remove repositories. To enable or disable a repo,
      select the repo from the list on the left and then click the
      Enabled checkbox in the detail area. If the box is already
      chaecked, then clicking it will disable this repo, and if it is
      not checked, clicking it will enable this repo.<br>
      <br>
      When the status of the Enabled checkbox changes, A button will
      appear to the right of the checkbox allowing you to apply that
      change. Once you click the change button, the system will reload
      its list of repositories and either add or remove the packages
      associated with that repository.<br>

    <h2><font size="+2">Removing a repository</font></h2>
    <font size="+2">You can remove a repositories here. You will be
      warned that the repo is about to be removed, and have the chance
      to change your mind. Generally is is much better to disable a repo
      than to remove it completely. Removing it will physically delete
      the configuration files from your system, and force the system to
      update its databases.<br>
