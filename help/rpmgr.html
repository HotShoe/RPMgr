    &nbsp;<font size="+2">RPMgr (RPM Manager) is a graphical interface
      for the RPM and DNF5 packages on Fedora 41 or higher. It is
      designed to duplicate the functionality and ease of use of the
      Debian Synaptic package closely. It is not a clone of Synaptic,
      but is supposed to be Synaptic-like in it's look and feel. <br>
      <br>
      RPMgr is a work in progress and is now in wide beta release. This
      is an update to show where the software stands today. Below are
      current screen shots of the completed dialogs and functions so
      far. I will keep this page updated to reflect the changes. If you
      are interested in beta testing RPMgr, please contact me at <a
        href="mailto:jem@mlsoft.org" moz-do-not-send="true">jem@mlsoft.org</a>.
      <br>
      <br>
      Source code is available to beta testers, but be aware that RPMgr
      is written entirely in object pascal. The source package comes
      with the information needed to compile the source. If you have
      experience in object pascal and wish to contribute to this
      project, please contact me at the email above. A GIT repository
      will be available when the package is released. For now I ask that
      source not be distributed.<br>
      <br>
      RPMgr is nearing its initial release goal, and has now been
      packaged in both binary and source RPM packages.<br>

      to www.mlsoft.org just shows a humorous message now, and only

      <b>Login</b><br>
      <img src="login.png" alt="login" width="712" height="279"><br>
      <br>
      RPMgr requires a valid sudo user login. This is a 3 login chances
      system before the program will halt. Clicking the Cancel button
      will also halt the program. Authentication is only done when the
      program opens. No login information is stored by RPMgr.<br>
      <br>
      Configuration<br>
      <img src="config.png" alt="Config" width="574" height="690"><br>
      The user can change the looks of RPMgr to their liking. RPMgr uses
      the QT widget set for a better look and feel to the components.
      The user can also choose between offline updates and standard real
      time updates. If real time is chosen (unchecking the Offline
      option), then a reboot notice is only shown if system files are
      affected by the update.<br>

      <b>Applying Actions</b><br>
      <img src="apply.png" alt="Apply" width="1080" height="662"><br>
      RPMgr uses a freeform style of marking and applying selected
      changes so that installing, removing and reinstalling packages can
      be done in one session.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Current Status</b><br>
      The above examples are working in the current version (0.9.8.6).
      The software has been through our normal beta testing channels and
      is now in wide beta testing. RPMgr is written in Object Pascal.
      This is because I am not good with C++ or Rust, and I am not
      nearly as comfortable in C as I am in FPC and Lazarus. Questions
      or comments are always welcome at the email link above.<br>
