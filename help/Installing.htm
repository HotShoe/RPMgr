    <h1 align="center"><font size="+3"><b>Installing Packages</b></font></h1>
    <font size="+2">RPMgr can install any rpm package available in the
      enabled repositories. It will also install any packages that must
      be installed for the new package to function.<br>
      <br>
      To find a package, you might use the search box at the top left of
      the main window. You can also look through the categories list.
      The search option is probably the fastest unless you know the
      category and are willing to find the package in there.<br>
      <br>
      How ever you go about looking for a particular package, once you
      find one that you want to install, just highlight it and right
      click to bring up the popup menu. There are menus in the search
      results dialog, right click the main window when your mouse cursor
      is in the Package list.<br>
      <br>
      Once you select an action for the highlighted package or group,
      you'll see the action dialog appear.<br>
      <img src="action.png" alt="actions" width="584" height="947"><br>
      The popup menu here lets you undo the last action, undo all
      actions, apply all actions, or close the action list. Closing the
      list does not affect the actions already listed, it just gets the
      list out of your way.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Applying actions</b><br>
      Selecting apply from the popup menu or clicking the Apply button,
      will bring up the dialog below.<br>
      <img src="apply.png" alt="apply" width="1327" height="822"><br>
      The Apply changes dialog lists all changes that will be made. It
      does that sorted by groups of changes to be done. In other words,
      all installations are listed together, and then removals,
      re-installs, etc. All actions of the same type are listed
      together.<br>
      <br>
      Once you are happy with the changes, you can click the Apply
      changes button, or you can cancel all change actions. The Cancel
      button does that. It cancels all changes listed and clears the
      action list.<br>
      <br>
      The Close button closes this dialog, but it does not affect
      anything on the list.<br>
      <br>
      Once you apply the changes listed, you will see each change as it
      happens and then a brief summary of what was done. Installing,
      uninstalling, or re-installing packages does not require a reboot.
      The majority of packages on your system can be installed or
      removed in real time without rebooting. Only updates and system
      upgrades require an automatic reboot (if offline updates are
      enabled).<br>
