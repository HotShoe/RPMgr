    <font size="+2" face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">The RPMgr
      software (RPM Manager) is a graphical desktop interface to the
      DNF5 and RPM programs used and distributed in the Fedora Linux
      operating system. RPMgr is designed to be easy to use and to
      understand by any level of Linux user. It allows you to install,
      remove, and reinstall packages into your Linux system. It also
      allows you to install entire groups of packages (called groups),
      and to remove installed groups. It will check for updates each
      time it is run, and allow you to install those updates in two
      different ways. It can also do a complete distribution upgrade to
      the next version of fedora, when one becomes available.</font><font

        Grab a nice beverage, have a seat, and let me show you how to
        make all of this work.<br>

          This is the first thing you will see when you run the RPMgr
          program. System security is paramount for any production
          operating system, whether it is at home on your desk, or in a
          large manufacturing company. This login requires you to enter
          your <b>sudo</b> password. <b>NOT</b> your root password. It
          will not be stored in any file or remembered once the program
          is closed. RPMgr has the ability to install, remove,
          re-install packages, and to manage package repositories, and
          so it is considered a system or administrative tool. For that
          reason, it needs elevated privileges to carry out those
          actions.<br>
          <br>
          You will have 3 attempts to login with correct credentials
          before RPMgr shuts itself down and closes. Clicking on the
          Cancel button will also end the program immediately.<br>
          <br>
          If all goes well, you will be logged in and will see a couple
          of messages and perhaps a notice that updates are available.
