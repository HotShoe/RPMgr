    <font size="+2">RPMgr can install any rpm package available in the
      enabled repositories. It will also install any packages that must
      be installed for the new package to function.<br>
      <br>
      To find a package, you might use the search box at the top left of
      the main window. You can also look through the categories list.
      The search option is probably the fastest unless you know the
      category and are willing to find the package in there.<br>
      <br>
      How ever you go about looking for a particular package, once you
      find one that you want to install, just highlight it and right
      click to bring up the popup menu. There are menus in the search
      results dialog, the main window when your mouse cursor is in the
      Package list.<br>
