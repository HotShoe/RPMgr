    <h1 align="center">Main RPMgr window</h1>
    <img src="main-updates.png" alt="main" width="1022" height="590"><br>
    <font size="+2"><br>
      This is the main window of RPMgr. It is the heart or controller of
      the software. This is where all of the work gets done. Across the
      top is the main menu with the , Options and Tasks, and the Help
      menus. Directly below that is the Search box.<br>
    </font><br>
    <font size="+2"><img src="file:///mnt/Data/rpmgr/help/optionmnu.png"
        alt="options" width="189" height="119">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><font

      <br>
      The buttons below the groups grid are a quick interface for
      getting to often used commands without using the menus.<br>
      <img src="actionbtns.png" alt="buttons" width="445" height="124"><br>
      <br>
      These buttons allow you to show all installed packages, what files
      are contained in the selected package. manage package
      repositories, update the packages on your system, fix any broken
      packages, and apply any changes you have made such as packages
      marked for installation or removal. When updates are available,
      the Updates button will be red instead of navy blue.<br>
      <br>
      To the right there are a couple of other buttons.<br>
      <img src="bottomrow.png" alt="bottom" width="849" height="29"><br>
      <br>
      These buttons allow you to test the integrity of the package
      databases, upgrade to the latest version of Fedora that is
      available, and to close the program and exit.<br>
      <br>
      the other point of interest on this window is the description
      panel.<br>
      <img src="desc.png" alt="desc" width="853" height="143"><br>
      <br>
      This is the description of the currently selected package. It
      includes the size of the package when installed and the size of
      the package compressed for downloading. Directly above this panel
      is some basic information about your Fedora system. It includes
      the total number of packages available in the active repositories,
      and how many of those packages are currently installed on your
      system.<br>
