    <font size="+2">RPMgr checks for updates each time it is run. If it
      finds one or more packages that needs to be updated, it displays a
      notice. It also changes the color of the Updates button on the
      main window, from navy blue, to red.<br>
      <img src="updates.png" alt="updates" width="1000" height="831"><br>
      The Updates section looks like this if there are updates to be
      installed. If there are none, you will see a message in the list
      box saying that. This window tells you how many updates are
      waiting and lists them in alphabetical order.<br>
      <br>
      To install these updates, simply click on the Install button, and
      RPMgr will do the rest. You will see each operation as it is
      performed in the light blue information box.<br>
      <br>
      When the updates are complete, you will see somthing like the
      following:<br>
      <img src="afterupdate.png" alt="after" width="1047" height="871"><br>
      Depending upon whether you have offline updates enabled or not,
      you will see a notice telling you that the system must now reboot
      to install the new updates. If you are not using the offline
      update feature (it is turned on by default), then you will only
      see a reboot option if currently running system files were
      updated. This is because those programs cannot be stopped and
      re-started while the system is running. You are not forced to
      reboot, but those programs will not be the latest version until
      you do reboot.<br>
