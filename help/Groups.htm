    <font size="+2">The Group grid lists all of the groups (categories)
      of packages that are available to you. Selecting different groups,
      displays the packages that are contained in that group in the
      Package grid to the right. You can install or uninstall entire
      groups from here, along with the required packages in each group.
      To do that, click on a group and then right click your mouse to
      bring up the popup menu. <br>

      This popup menu has all of the actions that you can perform on the
      selected group. Normally these would be the Install Group and
      Remove Group items, but you can also undo previous actions, or
      apply any changes as well. <br>
      <br>
      Again, this menu enables only actions that you can do at this
      time. So, if a group is already installed, then the Install option
      will be disabled, etc.<br>
