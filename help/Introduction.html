    <font size="+2" face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">The RPMgr
      software (RPM Manager) is a graphical desktop interface to the
      DNF5 and RPM programs used and distributed in the Fedora Linux
      operating system. RPMgr is designed to be easy to use and to
      understand by any level of Linux user. It allows you to install,
      remove, and reinstall packages into your Linux system. It also
      allows you to install entire groups of packages (called groups),
      and to remove installed groups. It will check for updates each
      time it is run, and allow you to install those update in two
      different ways. It can also do a complete distribution upgrade to
      the next version of fedora, when one becomes available.</font><font
