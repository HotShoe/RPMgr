      You can install or uninstall entire groups at a time. To do that
      click on the group that you want to operate on and then right
      click your mouse. Then you will see a popup menu with options that
      you can perform. You can choose to install the selected group if
      it is not already installed. You can also uninstall the group if
      it is installed, or you can undo the last or all actions, or apply
      all changes.<br>

      From this point, you should see the <a href="Installing.htm">Installing</a>
      topic since the operations are identical.<br>
